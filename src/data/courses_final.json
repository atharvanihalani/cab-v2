    "description": "Literary historians generally agree that in the 1970s, in the U.S., there was a significant increase in the publication of diverse forms of African American literature. The 1970s is also often described by scholars as a decade in which there was a renaissance of African American women's writing as well as the publication of several experimental African American literary works. In this seminar, we will study this lively period in African American literary history primarily through novels, some of them recently republished or adapted into other forms. What idea of African American literature do we get when we read novels from this era? What questions were asked in 1970s African American novels that we continue to ask now? Novels we will likely read include detective fiction, diaristic fiction, satirical fiction, a love story, and historical fiction.",

    "description": "This discussion-based seminar considers the critical question of Black revolt and its relationship to politics and morality. From the slave revolts of the 1800s century to the Black revolutionary movements of the 1960s, we will cover recurrent themes related to Black revolt through an interdisciplinary array of historical and literary sources, as well as scholarly texts. Discussions will focus on the various contributions of Black thinkers and actors who have faced the issue of revolt, and how they confront around ideas surrounding sovereignty, violence, and politics. Critically we will consider the question: What is at stake in Black revolt? Throughout the course we think comparatively across multiple contexts (enslavement, colonization, systematic oppression) to consider how the relationship between Blackness and revolt emerges, shifts, and what it means for our foundational concepts of Western order such as politics, morality, and rationality.",

In this seminar, we will discuss African love stories as complex narratives about romantic relationships, as political fiction, and as spaces where African artists reflect on romantic love, romantic desire, and the idea of romance. In what ways do African love stories published in the twentieth century still speak to us today? How do twenty-first century African artists use love stories to confront contemporary societal concerns?",

It is, as well, meant to think about how all of these histories have been represented popularly and politically in the very recent past.",

BAM artists used ritual, poetry, music, song, dance, and theatre to identify, disrupt, and examine human thought and action that produced and sustained racism, poverty, colonialism, and sexism. In our class, students will study BAM manifestos, poetry, and plays designed to transform audiences. These course readings will be augmented by regular, on-your-feet, interactive workshops in BAM performance techniques such as improvisational theatre, agit-prop, and the choreopoem. Along the way, we will also dive into the origins of Brown's own Rites & Reason Theatre (est. 1971), and the importance of community-engaged participant research in the African American theatre tradition.",

Reading narratives from a select group of instances, we will explore, against the broader theoretical work on global revolutions, the more specific meaning of revolution in Africana history and literature. The overriding question is, in the face of disappointing outcomes, tragedy and collapse, can the history of Black revolt and revolution still provide a framework for thinking about radical change in the 21st Century, or should we move beyond it?",

It introduces students to some of the key thinkers around race in Latin America, the Caribbean and the US, to better understand how ideas of race cross boundaries and intersect to generate specific racial hierarchies. It pays particular attention to how ideas around race respond to broader global forces. It uses migration within Latin America and the Caribbean as a concrete instance for exploring historic and contemporary manifestation of anti-Black racism, and as sites for community building and resistance.",

Trans*formative Ecologies understands trans and environmental study as co-articulable collaborators speaking to and working with each other as endeavors that unstick the fixities that organize our sociopolitical landscape, interrogate systems of power, and daringly imagine otherwise with an openness to change amid a climate of multiple urgencies. This seminar introduces students to conversations in trans studies and decolonial environmental humanities through key texts in both fields, with consideration to subaltern theories and methodologies, cultural geography, literary studies, creative practice, and visual & aesthetic culture. These approaches contribute to and diverge from canonical feminist and queer theory, and renegotiate the anthropocentric, Western framework that often dominates dialogue pertaining to environmental study. Brought together, these fields collectively scrutinize dominant modes of thinking, conventional approaches, and methods of inquiry.",

The 21st century has seen a proliferation of LGBTQ+ representation in media through an apparently progressive political moment \u2013 from the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell to federal legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. However, these new media have also come up among increased censorship, book bans, and homo- and transphobic violence, in a reflection of the not-so-linear story of queer representation. By examining memoir, film, television, and internet cultures, we will explore these developments through a framework of queer that goes beyond sexual orientation, and consider the role of the non-normative under racial capitalism, heteropatriarchy, the carceral state, and United States empire across oceans.",

Characterized by scholars as neo-slave narratives and, later, post-neo slave narratives, contemporary fictions of US slavery deploy the formal features and thematic concerns of the slave narrative to reveal Black freedom dreams of later periods. Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.",

This shift is reshaping everything\u2014from healthcare demands and pension systems to labor markets and technological innovation. In this course we will examine the experiences of growing old. We will explore what it means to grow old within societies, families, workplaces, and social networks. We will examine prevalent attitudes and stereotypes about age and aging that shape interpersonal and institutional practices. Through an examination of lived experiences, cultural beliefs, and social practices, we will develop a clear understanding of the experience of aging.",

We will address the various ways that experiences, processes and consequences linked to different migrations are gendered. The course will introduce a range of geographical contexts and empirical examples/case studies with the aim to challenge the US centrism existent in many academic debates. We will analyze relevant power relations and forms of oppression, as well as resistance strategies by migrants, asylum seekers and refugees. The course will use an intersectional lens to explore the way different power configurations interplay in specific contexts, paying particular attention to patriarchy, heteronormativity, nationalism, racism, Islamophobia and class-based inequalities. We will engage economic, political, social and cultural dimensions, but also the politics of non/belonging, and cultural productions.",

Our class will begin from the premise that politics of social difference are central, rather than peripheral, to transnational capitalism, and we will challenge the idea of the \"economic\" as a bounded and predetermined domain. Throughout our class, we will examine how race, gender, and sexuality connect to economic and demographic change through topics such as kinship, care, health, labor and exchange across contexts like the US, South Korea, Chile, Kenya and elsewhere. Looking to ethnographic scholarship and media, we will ask not only how market reforms shape subjectivities, desires, and everyday life but also how people work to resist and reimagine these conditions in return.

It introduces students to key concepts in social studies of the environment, such as contamination, embodiment, perspectivism, dispossession, and structural violence. The course focuses on developing theoretical and methodological resources for analyzing contemporary environmental issues through a cross-cultural perspective, including: plantation agriculture, epigenetics, nuclear fallout, climate change, and invasive species management. Students will acquire the research skills to trace links between issues like industrial pesticide use and diet culture; oil spills and colonialism; access to clean water and urbanization. From fossil fuels to animal rights, this course explores how contemporary environmental dilemmas related to consumption, production, and destruction play out in our everyday lives, and asks: can we do anything about it?",

    "description": "Environmental anthropology is rooted in a classic dialectical conundrum: in order to trouble the specious line between nature and culture, you need to take that line seriously. Ethnography is a powerful medium for navigating this conundrum; ethnographic monographs render nature as a legible category that emerges through humans' everyday lives, political systems, and cultural infrastructures. Ethnographic monographs position the environment as a conceptual genre for understanding nature/culture &quot;intra-actions.&quot; We will examine the writing conventions, theoretical paradigms, and qualitative data of full-length ethnographies on environmental conservation, forests, flooding, human/animal relations, energy, extractivism, soil, and waste, considering these texts as media for negotiating the nature/culture divide. This course will focus both on foundational monographs in environmental anthropology and recent monographs published over the last decade. the course will illuminate how the ethnographic genre of the environment took form and has evolved.",

This requires both experimental microbiology and computational analysis. In this CURE class, we carry out a novel, scientifically important experiment related to polymicrobial fermentation. We analyze the data using traditional microbiological techniques alongside sequencing and computational methods. Together, we write and submit a manuscript for publication based on our findings. In 2025, for example, the class focused on kimchi and published here: https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/14/11/1948. In addition to the research project, students give presentations on other fermented foods and, for the final project, propose a new experiment to be conducted in the following year's class.

If we share the same genetic content, why are our cells different, and why do they perform distinct functions? Why do some diseases profoundly affect gene regulation without a genetic mutation to explain them? The epigenome, a dynamic layer of information associated with genetic material (beyond DNA), plays a crucial role in creating genetic diversity. This course will examine epigenetic mechanisms, their regulation, and their impact on various biological layers, from cellular processes to diseases, brain circuits, psychological disorders, and social behavior. While the primary focus will be on human health and disease, students will also explore non-human case studies, investigating a range of organisms, including plants and animals, to demonstrate the diversity and complexity of epigenetic mechanisms.",

    "description": "Aging is a fundamental biological process. It is the major risk factor for age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, osteoporosis, arthritis and Alzheimer's, just to name a few. As life expectancy has increased in the 20th century, these diseases have become the leading causes of death. Recent research has identified universal mechanisms that regulate organismal aging and impact all organ systems. Several gene networks that can regulate the rate of aging and multiple age-related diseases have already been discovered. These mechanisms are conserved throughout evolution and many key insights have been garnered from simple model organisms. Manipulation of these networks has been achieved by diet, genetic engineering, and most recently, with drugs. The goal of modern medicine is to increase healthy survival, as opposed to simply longevity. It is now generally acknowledged that increasing health span \u2013 the fraction of our life spans free of frailty and debilitating chronic disease \u2013 has become a realistic goal. This course will examine the new concept of &quot;geroscience&quot; \u2013 the molecular, cellular, and genetic foundations of the biology of aging, and how this knowledge can be applied to therapies for age-associated diseases. Course material will be based on the primary research literature. Prerequisites are a background in cell biology, molecular biology and genetics - such as BIOL0470, BIOL0280, BIOL0200, and BIOL0800.",

This course examines the varied encounters between the Greeks and groups local to different parts of the Mediterranean, usually subsumed under the often unhelpful umbrella term 'others'. In this course, we will examine the most iconic of these encounters, and think how they shaped all actors involved. We will do so by referencing and questioning archaeological, iconographic, and textual evidence. We will also think about how different types of mobility forged connectivity and interregional networks, shaped exchange and trade, and enabled flow of ideas. We will also investigate how intercultural contact affected people's lives and how it changed their views of themselves and others.",

    "description": "Horden and Purcell's The Corrupting Sea was swiftly established as a landmark study of the ancient Mediterranean with its publication in 2000 and has remained such in the intervening years. The monumental work covers three millennia of human history and highlights the long-standing connectivity of highly fragmented Mediterranean microregions. While drawing on a long and rich tradition of Mediterranean-centered scholarship, it is distinguished by its authors as a study of the human history of the Mediterranean rather than of history in the Mediterranean. This course considers the research traditions out of which this work developed and explores its marked influence on scholarship in the 25 years since its publication.",

Challenging the universality of current feminist and attendant theories, we will move to an array of literary, religious, prescriptive, and medical texts in Sanskrit, Persian and vernacular languages (all in translation) to uncover gender relations in this period. From the fierce goddesses Durga and Kali, and the gender-bending god Vishnu, we move to the Kamasutra and Ayurvedic texts before gradually moving to colonial ruptures and the subsequent modern imaginings of premodern women across various media.",

Although our individual actions may be simple, emergent patterns of collective behavior can be complex, as in ant colonies, bird flocks, and work teams. Similarly, as individual humans, we know little. We overestimate our knowledge and the depth of our arguments. Yet as a society we have achieved great things through a community of knowledge, guided by shared intentionality. This has enabled us to build ships and economies, but also leads to the belief that we know more than we do and can amplify vacuous ideology, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. In this seminar, we will investigate what can be learned from the parallels and divergences between collective behavior and collective cognition. We will draw from literatures in animal behavior, complex systems, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, and computer science.",

    "description": "Does logic only dictate how people ought to reason or can it also describe how human reasoning naturally works? In linguistics, the best theories of how language conveys meaning propose that word meanings have an abstract and formal logical structure. But in psychology, the best theories of people's reasoning argue that it is naturally flawed, biased, and deeply content-dependent rather than formal. In this course, we will explore this tension and work toward resolving it in order to understand whether and how much human reasoning really is inherently logical. We'll draw on existing research across the cognitive sciences, and come up with proposals of our own for what the next research steps might be.",

Deep learning networks have pushed the state of the art on a range of challenging problems that had until now seemed out of reach for machines. At the same time, these neural networks have also led to progress in computational neuroscience with improved models of neural responses in higher visual cortical areas. The goal of this course is to provide an advanced introduction to deep learning from the joint perspective of machine learning and neuroscience.",

The course does not cover mixed-effects (multi-level) analysis, covariance structure analysis (PCA, FA, SEM), or Bayesian statistics. The minimum prerequisite statistics knowledge assumed for the course will be undergraduate statistics, as covered in CLPS 0900 or comparable courses. Thus, the course assumes knowledge of such basics as point estimates, confidence intervals, normal distributions, hypothesis testing, t tests, univariate linear regression, and one-way ANOVA.

The goal of this course is to consolidate many of these tools into a single course.

The course encourages students to re-define science and technology in the context of China's changing Confucian education system, booming market economy, and the multiethnic empire and explores the impact of imperial legacy in scientific imagination in contemporary China. By drawing on materials from local museums as well as latest Chinese science fictions, we will investigate the ways in which knowledge about medicine, handicrafts, and foreign lands transformed the form and content of novels and belle-lettres.",

By examining the categories of courtesan (entertainers), concubines (secondary consorts), and wives, we will see how the Chinese gender system evolved over time. We will examine how the gender system was both shaped by other social and cultural phenomena and in turn impacted other aspects of culture and society. The course follows a roughly chronological trajectory: each section of the course will be devoted to a particular set of historical issues that was particularly salient in that period. We will examine how gender relations intersected with philosophical ideals, political agendas, religious values, and economic developments, and how individuals navigated the gender system to construct meaningful lives.",

We also examine the impact of government policy and healthcare institutions on health outcomes in the U.S., with an emphasis placed on determining the credibility of empirical evidence. Consequently, we survey the issues that arise when attempting to draw causal inferences from non-experimental data and the types of research designs and econometric tools that can address potential sources of bias.

The course aims to ground this in economic theory and empirical analyses: as such, many of the readings will be recent journal articles and working papers. By the end of this course, students will be familiar with the systematic forces that drive financial fragility, and the tradeoffs that policy makers face before, during, and after the crises. They will be able to apply the framework to analyze real world scenarios and current events.",

We will study the risks that rising temperatures and sea levels as well as extreme weather events pose to schools and learning. We will examine what schools teach students about climate science and environmental stewardship. Much of the class will focus on case studies of school systems addressing climate change through a range of initiatives such as developing environmental education curriculum, investing in clean-energy infrastructure, launching community-based demonstration projects, and preparing students for the new green economy. Students will develop skills in reading, critiquing, and synthesizing academic research as well as generating evidence-based policy recommendations. We will take an applied, solutions-oriented approach to grappling with the concrete challenges schools face in advancing these efforts.",

Some of these students are educated with their peers, and some are educated in school settings that can cost over $500,000 relative to an average spending of $17,000 per pupil nationally. There are many complex issues related to gifted and special education. At the end of this course, students will have a deep understanding of gifted and special education and be positioned to continue engaging on these issues in future studies. The course requires no prior knowledge.",

Artificial Intelligence is not simply a technology to be adopted or managed; it exposes the structural contradictions and limits of traditional education itself: how neoliberal logics shape institutions, how outdated cognitive models persist, and how assessment practices reduce understanding to proxies. \"AI cheating,\" for example, will be explored not as a moral failure but as evidence of a system that prioritizes representation over reality. Through readings, discussions, and projects involving generative AI tools, students will engage three threads: (1) critical analysis of both educational and AI systems, (2) epistemological tensions embedded in approaches to cognition and learning, and (3) design strategies for addressing AI's \"colonization\" of teaching and learning.",

As we learn about various theories and the theorists behind them, we consider their effect on our construction of students' learning and teachers' practice. Through reading research in educational psychology and other disciplines, we will examine topics such as learning- and teaching-related beliefs and behaviors, cognitive and socioemotional processes, and motivation that can be applied to teaching approaches and classroom environments. Special attention will be given to sociocultural contexts that affect learning processes and experiences of diverse students. In doing so, we see how these theoretical paradigms are refined with respect to difference, diversity, and intersectionality.",

Together we'll unravel how air moves and how circulations organize themselves into weather patterns and climate systems, from gentle sea breezes to powerful mid-latitude cyclones. Along the way, you'll discover the laws that govern these motions and learn to interpret them through the lens of real-world phenomena. We'll cover the essentials of atmospheric motion, including geostrophic balance, vorticity dynamics, boundary layer processes, and baroclinic instability, and see how these ideas explain features such as planetary waves, fronts, and the global circulation that keeps Earth's climate in balance. The emphasis will be on physical interpretation of the equations but some facility with vector calculus is very important. Contact professor through cab for pre-req overrides (case by case.)",

In this class we will critically examine ancient sources to understand not just what happened in this dynamic span of time but also how we as scholars can know about it. Who wrote what texts for what purposes, and how does the nature of these sources affect our ability to understand Egypt? Can we use literature as historical evidence? Utilizing primary sources in translation - sometimes multiple translations of the same text so we can critique translators - this course equips students to approach the history of an ancient but perennially fascinating place and culture.

We will also consider the history of science fiction and read contemporary fiction that continues to interrogate ideas of objective observation, especially across lenses of gender and race.

We will trace how the Uncanny and the hauntings from a colonial past inform the present as the afterlives of colonialism, and how colonial thought continues to design modern realities and politics. We will also think about the distinction between the Uncanny and horror and learn how these affective genres can help us articulate new postcolonial realities.

    "description": "\"Why do we dream?\" may be an intriguing question, but ultimately one for science to answer. On the other hand, \"What can we do with dreams?\" is a question that people have approached from an almost limitless number of perspectives over thousands of years. Whether envisioned as a source of philosophical insight, a refuge for unspeakable desires, or an experience to be intentionally manipulated, the space of the dream is an unfailingly fascinating one-- and the works that have been created to explore it are equally as fascinating. In this course, we will engage with various cultural texts about dreams, which may include: The Dream of Scipio (Cicero), the Parliament of Fowls (Chaucer), Godless but Loyal to Heaven (Van Camp), Paprika (Kon), and Inception (Nolan). No previous experience with literary traditions or ability to remember one's own dreams necessary.",

We will begin our exploration of genre bending by honing our powers of observation, conversation, and research through a series of guided activities designed to deepen our understanding of various people and places (real and imagined) from which our literary projects spring forth. While we work on building out our own personal, soon-to-be-bent, archives, we will simultaneously read contemporary works of literature from those known for their reckless regard of traditional genre boundaries: Layli Long Soldier, C.D.

What does it mean to read historical archives and manuscripts literarily\u2014with close attention to their language and form? And what makes indenture narratives into modern narratives of \"odyssey?\" In the latter half of the course, we will study contemporary forms of Asian migrant labor, including guest work, sex work, and domestic work, interrogating what changes and what remains the same across the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.",

    "description": "We are often all too familiar with the question 'where is home?' when we encounter strangers or find ourselves in a new environment. In this course, we will explore the narratives of African women writers on travel and return, with a specific focus on ideas of home, identity, and (un)belonging. Spanning works from 1982 to 2020, we'll travel with these writers from East, South, and West Africa to Europe, North America, and the United Kingdom to explore the complications of home, identity, and (un)belonging. We will consider various attempts to make meaning of 'belonging' in these migratory texts while reflecting on our own situations, e.g., coming from somewhere else and residing temporarily in Rhode Island to study. Our primary texts will serve as vehicles for movement from Africa to other parts of the world.",

What work happens beyond these hours? What does and does not count as work and why? How is work differently configured along lines of race, gender, sexuality, class, and dis/ability? In order to address these questions, we will trouble imaginaries of \"free\" labor through attention to enslaved and indentured labor, reproductive and sex work, and migrant and gig work in a global economy. From Herman Melville's satire, \"Bartleby, the Scrivener,\" to Karl Marx's and Adam Smith's theories of labor, to workplace films like Jeanne Dielman and Office Space, this course explores representations of work in its diverse and ubiquitous forms, spanning the age of colonialism to our contemporary global division of labor.",

Our study is organized along two axes: The first reckons with colonial modernity's role in constructing the aesthetic as a racializing technology to measure and impose taste, sensibility, reason and/as civilizational capacity. The second grapples with the political orientations that, nonetheless, undergird contemporary black cultural production across literary genres and visual/media forms. Engaging such thinkers as \u00c9douard Glissant, Saidiya Hartman, Denise Ferreira da Silva, Phillip Brian Harper, Sylvia Wynter, and Kevin Quashie, among others, we will study such black aesthetic theories as opacity, fabulation, excess, dissimulation, (anti-)representation, and black world(ing).",

We attend to the long history of this multivalent and multicombinant racism in two ways, by 1) studying pre-modern forms of collective hatred and fear that emerged prior to the putative stabilization of race as an identitarian category, and 2) exploring how to conceptualize relationally the various racial formations that emerged in modernity out of the slave trade, colonialism, and Nazism. Theorists we study include: daSilva, Foucault, Heng, Mbemb\u00e9, Said, Spillers, Wolfe, and Wynters. The literary works we read include: The King of Tars, The Canterbury Tales, The Tempest, Jane Eyre, Ceremony, Jasmine, and Beloved.",

While we believe that innovation is generally desirable, the reality is that the great majority of innovations either fail to be accepted or face strong criticism. The course is in part a theoretical framework starting with the concepts outlined in Geoff Moore's Crossing the Chasm and extended to a broad range of innovation and complete methodology for anticipating points of resistance and for creating strategy to overcome them. Another part is a series of case studies of innovations and their trajectories to eventual acceptance or to failure. Finally, the course is a laboratory experimenting with students' own ideas for innovation.",

Topics to be covered include the fundamentals of laser operation, gain and gain saturation, resonators, single-mode and multi-mode lasers, and a selection of important laser examples. We will then discuss light-matter interactions in the nonlinear regime, relying on a classical or semi-classical treatment. Topics will include frequency conversion via mixing or parametric processes, and degenerate third-order self-induced effects. Time permitting, we will discuss some of the most recent breakthroughs in optically-driven nonlinear processes such as laser-induced fusion as well as the planned exascale laser systems currently under development.",

Such flows have a variable density over space and time. They can expand to take the shape of volume or be compressed into a confined space. These flows surround (air), inflate (air in lungs), compress (impact), hold/push (drag/thrust), and levitate (flight). Investigate flows to design and take advantage of their behavior for engineering solutions (e.g., extracting energy). Learn to identify a fluid and develop the framework (differential equations) describing compressible flow motion/dynamics. Study fundamental thin airfoil, wing, and boundary layer theory. Consider extracting energy from air flows using wind turbines. Solve the Euler equations using analysis and numerical methods. The course concludes by surveying advanced topics involving supersonics, hypersonics, and space propulsion. Prerequisites: ENGN 0720 and ENGN 0810.",

These group-based, research-driven design engineering projects serve to illuminate skills and professional ambitions. They become the basis for building portfolios and integrate prior components of the program into a coherent whole. To start, the previously completed project proposal is developed for execution. It is refined to include further details such as project planning, professional audience and advisor identification, and budgeting. The remaining self-directed process will go on to include client interactions, user and market research, collaborative practice, realization strategies, prototyping and testing, and methods to \"tell the story\" of how the artifacts developed fit in the world.",

    "description": "Communication is a vital component of effective collaboration. In this 4-week course, students learn how the extended human-centered design process can apply and be implemented by graphical and language-based communication for different audiences. Beginning with exercises framing the challenge of identifying and engaging different audiences, students will consider the broad variety of design engineering audiences and their information consumption and dissemination behaviors. Identify, adapt and create appropriate communication strategies for a variety of objectives and contexts, such as individual inquiry, eliciting feedback or engaging support. Students teach each other, bringing tools and approaches from their disciplinary homes to this shared endeavor. This studio transitions discussions of effective communication to drafting the Capstone Studio proposal. Initial drafts are used as the basis for learning; they are developed and transformed from detailed statements of interest to a group proposal for all participants.",

We will examine how knowledge production and socio-economic structures and processes relate to environmental change across economic, political, social, and ecological contexts. The first part of the course will introduce political ecology's roots and major arguments. We will use this foundation to analyze real-world cases and consider the opportunities, or \"openings,\" for different environmental futures.",

The use of policy tools such as protected areas and marine spatial planning has exploded in recent decades, and global interest in alternative energy, food security, and biodiversity conservation has heightened their use and critique in conservation and resilience. With a focus on coastal and marine contexts, the course will explore practical questions such as: What policy tools are available for conservation management? How are they designed, implemented, and adaptively managed in particular contexts? Real world case studies in sites such as Rhode Island, Hawaii, Bermuda, and the high seas will inform discussions and help us consider what factors might contribute to management success or failure. Along the way, students will gain experience using public engagement tools such as participatory mapping and focus groups.",

Why does it matter to engage with this topic? Maps are our powerful tools to tell stories, but what is the story behind them? What makes a map design effective? In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of cartography and map design. Students will critique and create appealing maps throughout the semester. There isn't a prerequisite for the course, however, an introductory level of GIS will be helpful to understand the terminology and the concepts. If you haven't taken any GIS course before, some basics will be covered during the training assignments. The majority of the hands-on exercises will be based on variety of software, therefore a basic level of computer skills is essential.",

We'll then look at organizations that operate our financial system like banks, asset managers, pension funds, insurers, and financial regulators.

Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming.

While studying these politics of access and authority worldwide and historically, we create our own community of knowledge and practice by going birding with adults or schoolchildren.

    "description": "How does the American public think about and talk about climate change, and how are these discussions shaped by the interventions of powerful interest groups and political elites? In this course, we will consider how individuals' understandings of climate change are deeply shaped by relations of power, from corporate strategies to delay meaningful action on climate change, to the norms and operations of media institutions, to dominant environmentalist discourses that fail to engage larger socioeconomic structures. While we will primarily discuss how public understanding has historically been constrained by the operation of power, we consider throughout possibilities for crafting climate narratives that resist these limitations to pursue transformative change. This course will focus primarily on climate politics in the United States, but we will also consider other national contexts and impacts on communities across the globe.",

This course builds upon and expands these frameworks by de-centering the human actor and approaching interspecies relationships through a more ecological lens. Rather than positioning humans as the primary subjects, we will explore how all beings\u2014plants, fungi, animals, landscapes, and humans\u2014are co-constituted through their entanglements. Through interdisciplinary readings spanning anthropology, ecology, philosophy, and environmental humanities, students will develop theoretical frameworks for understanding human/more-than-human relationships. We will then put these frameworks into practice through fieldwork, observational studies, and creative visualization projects. Students will learn to document, interpret, and represent these entanglements across ecological, cultural, and aesthetic dimensions, experimenting with multimedia storytelling to capture relationships that often exceed conventional representation.",

    "description": "\"Colonialism caused the climate crisis.\" Statements about the colonial origins and nature of our current environmental crises are increasingly common. They are often implicitly referring to global environmental inequalities in the causes and effects of these inequalities, suggesting that the Global North holds responsibility for causing problems like climate change, and that the Global South is largely affected by them. Does this mean that these inequalities are colonial though? What is colonialism, and how does it cause or shape global environmental inequalities? What are other elements and explanations for global environmental inequalities? In addition to asking and answering these questions, we will examine the actors and mechanisms by which colonialism and other social forces propagate environmental inequalities. We will also briefly examine how these arguments about how these large-scale inequalities are created might help us tackle them.",

It also analyzes the very diverse sources of Fanon's works (from C\u00e9saire to Lacan) as well as the historical movements from which it drew its inspiration (the Algerian war of liberation). While reading Fanon in the historical context of the French Empire and the \"francophone world\", the seminar also addresses his multiple and sometimes contradictory legacies and thus wishes to open a space for new creative and critical readings of the Fanonian text.

Everywhere, the barriers to women's economic engagement reach beyond work and salary to encompass property ownership, capital, credit, and markets. When considered as a whole, these barriers constitute economic exclusion, not just economic inequality. To date, policy, scholarship, and activism on the economic status of women have tended to focus on inequality in the formal workplace, but the full pattern is much more visible when women-owned businesses are examined.",

This seminar investigates the politics of non-normative gender and sexuality transnationally across contexts like Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines, and Pakistan. The course challenges the idea of North America as the center of authority on trans/queer knowledge and community. Readings will be organized topically and cover interdisciplinary ethnographic and theory-based scholarship on non-normative gender and sexuality in Asia, broadly conceived. We'll approach the terms \"queer,\" \"trans,\" and \"Asia\" as heterogenous, mobile, and changing concepts. We'll examine how they are constructed and contested, as well as how they intersect with dynamics of race, kinship, activism, migration, class, religion, and neoliberalism (among others). The course aims to complicate Euro-American epistemologies in disciplines like queer studies, anthropology, and the social sciences more generally.",

What distinguishes between men, women, and those who fall into neither category? What does it mean to grow \"up?\" How do language and culture influence cognition? Are selfishness, sympathy, and aggression innate, learned, or neither? Topics include Maasai childhoods, gender roles in Papua New Guinea, counting in the Amazon, Ojibwe spirits, religious violence in India, and spirit possession in Greece, Mexico, and Morocco.",

In this discussion-based seminar, we will examine initiatives and artifacts across the Americas that involve cultural production as a vehicle for reparation and restorative justice.

Case studies include \"Fragmentos\" by Doris Salcedo in collaboration with survivors of gender-based violence, the Chicago-based project Notes for Peace, and Cristina Rivera Garza's book Liliana's Invincible Summer. For the final project, we will identify an issue related to gender-based violence or inequality in our communities and design a proposal for addressing it using art and culture to promote restorative justice practices.

Beyond an introduction to trans studies, students will learn how dominant relations of power might be understood differently by starting from trans perspectives. By reading trans theory alongside works of trans literature and film, students will develop their own trans studies of gender, sexuality, race, and class.",

How might scholars working on gender/sexuality acknowledge disciplinary boundaries and use disciplinary training effectively? We will start with the premise that studies in gender and sexuality are tied together by questioning foundational assumptions within a given field of knowledge and taking account of our own subject positions vis-\u00e0-vis our objects of study. By studying canonical theoretical texts alongside disciplinary studies characterized by a feminist and/or queer focus, we will investigate how gender and sexuality are constructed in various contexts, what kind of work they do, and how standards of evidence are marshaled in particular disciplines. Particular attention will be given to the role of critique, affect, and materialisms, including the materiality of language, in gender and sexuality studies.",

But our ways of being with the dead always also pertain to ourselves and our future. After contemplating Heidegger's reflections on being with the dead in Being and Time, we will conduct a series of case studies drawn from art and critical thought, including Derrida's \"Life-Death\" seminar, Barthes' Mourning Diary, the prose and poetry of Kafka, Rilke, and Celan, Adorno's reflections on art \"after Auschwitz,\" and other works.",

Questions of the meaning of materials, functions, and urban imagery will be addressed with particular emphasis on acquiring greater fluency with the graphic tools and iterative processes through which designers conceptualize, synthesize, and represent the complex conditions of site, program, tectonics, and materiality to create urban landscapes. The city of Providence usually serves as a case study for observation and testing ground for your ideas, in addition to providing a site for your imaginary project. Students will come away with enhanced proficiency in representational techniques and a greater awareness of the social conditions of architectural production.",

The notion that art's relationship to society is one of negation, diagnosis, and destabilization pervades modern art history.

Alongside texts on critique in philosophy and theory, we will examine artists for whom criticality is paramount: Dada's ballistic mission, repetitions of the neo-avant-garde, anti-art, institutional critique, critical postmodernism, art as undercommons. We will end with recent claims of critique's collapse and assess the viability of criticality in art of today.",

    "description": "This seminar examines the state of the field in historical studies of modern colonialism and imperialism and built environments. By reading and discussing recent publications in architectural history, urban studies, anthropology, history, literary studies, and colonial and postcolonial studies, the course identifies new approaches in the field, including a focus on intersections between colonialism and ecological disaster, development and the redistribution of land during and after colonialism, distinctive forms of labor that emerged in colonial built environment contexts, consumption practices and their role in nurturing new markets and new social classes, and strategies for navigating the contemporary material legacies of colonialism such as monuments and toponymy. Our study revolves around two principal questions: How was the built environment leveraged to support and sometimes challenge colonial and imperial ideologies? In turn, how have postcolonial societies worked to transform colonial built discourses?",

Defining reprography broadly to encompass all pre-photographic technologies of graphic impression, it explores the transfers that occurred within and between piece-mold bronze casting, ceramic molding, sealing, rubbing, and woodblock printing as they developed in succession and tandem over the past four millennia. In particular, the seminar considers the extent to which technics of transfer facilitated the movement of images across medium and time.",

    "description": "This collaborative seminar examines artists' innovations amidst the commercial ambitions of the East India Company at major ports and centers of trade across Asia. Within the period of the Company's relentless pursuit of profits, artists trained in India, China, and Britain forged relationships across cultures and experimented with materials and techniques to produce striking artworks. This course interrogates the relationship between these artists and a corporation. It asks whether \"style\" links such disparate arts through subjects of colonial interest\u2014including portraits and ethnographic types, landscapes and architectural drawings, plants and animals\u2014or if the description holds only through the terminology of \"Company\" art that developed as the British empire waned. Students will engage with these arts in Brown's collections, and in the exhibition, Painters, Ports & Profits: Artists and the East India Company, 1760-1830, at the Yale Center for British Art.",

The notion that art's relationship to society is one of negation, diagnosis, and destabilization pervades modern art and its historiography. This seminar will trace the development of criticality as both an artistic practice and art-historical methodology. Alongside foundational texts on critique in philosophy and cultural theory, we will examine artists for whom criticality is paramount: Dada's ballistic mission, repetitions of the neo-avant-garde, antiart, institutional critique, critical postmodernism, art as undercommons. We will end with recent claims of critique's collapse and assess the viability of criticality in art of today.",

Historiographically, this period has been termed Europe's age of exploration. From the Americas, however, it could be better characterized as the age of extraction. We will probe the writings of key authors and texts from Colonial Latin America on the tension between exploring (associated with the deeply human capacity for curiosity and wonder) and extracting (the result of the also very human impulse to possess and accumulate). In our readings, we will see how at times the two are indistinguishable (a slippage that is evident in the Portuguese \"explora\u00e7ao\" meaning \"exploitation\"); at others, we will glimpse at the authors' desire to replenish landscapes, restitute rights and reimagine worldviews beyond the regimes brought forth by the adjective \"Colonial\".

We will weigh, too, how adopting an oceanic perspective can open new ways of understanding the past, present, and future of our planet and its inhabitants. Topics considered include contemporary and historic Indigenous seafaring traditions and maritime subjectivities across Moana/Pacific and other oceanic basins; Atlantic seaborne empires, piracy, human trafficking in the age of sail; the establishment of oceanography as a scholarly discipline; the evolution of maritime transportation infrastructure under global capitalism; the political ecology of a warming ocean in the era of climate crisis.",

Both fields of agree that natural disasters are windows onto the societies they strike and are processes emerging from historical human and nonhuman causes. Natural disasters, they agree, are unnatural. Studying a range of environmental processes from melting glaciers in the Andes to radioactive pollution west of Rockies, this course adopts a hemispheric scope to connect geographical, temporal, and thematic fields of history. We will think together about the agency of American environments and the hazards that haunt them. We draw on diverse methods to examine the roles that race, power, indigeneity, disability, gender, and science play in the history of (un)natural disasters. These methods will help us analyze primary sources while also encouraging curiosity for overlooked American communities and environments.",

Students will examine current issues and how they relate to historical processes such as Indigenous epistemologies; the origins, development, decline, and legacy of the federal residential, boarding, and day school system; the meaning of apologies; and the importance of language revitalization. Additionally, students will study how Indigenous activists, storytellers, and artists have used colonial mediums to combat colonialism and resist epistemicide: the eradication of Indigenous knowledge. Students will use discussion periods to analyze and reflect on their own lives and how their gender, ethnicity, and privilege relates to, contributes to, or challenges, Indigenous issues.

The Dalai Lama-led Ganden Phodrang state emerged in Lhasa with the ambitious ruler and his coterie displaying their power through new art and infrastructure. Further east, the Manchus, despite being a minority in Confucian China, rose to become the Qing emperors in Beijing. As they expanded the empire's territories to include the Inner Asian regions of Mongolia and Tibet, they projected a complex model of Buddhist kingship to gain legitimacy among the new subjects. How are these historical developments reflected in the material and print culture of this period (17th-19th centuries)? Each week, we will cover one theme of Buddhist material culture. Topics include book publishing and written technology; monastic architecture and replication of infrastructure; creation of statues, paintings and ritual objects among others.",

We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself.

This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean, and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. We will track the making and unmaking of the British Empire by studying the evolution of global trade, labor regimes including slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, as well as new ideas about governance, race, and identity.",

Focused on the canonical texts of African American women, this class gestures toward diaspora as well. Moving chronologically from the history of slavery to the present will require that we simultaneously confront the question of what counts as \"intellectual\" history. Thus even as we will read the written words of black feminists across time, we will also call into question what Barbara Christian calls \"the race for theory,\" turning also to resistance practices, material culture, and bodily performance as sites of black feminist theorization.",

Together we shall navigate a range of imperial, colonial, and national legal systems in the region via select case studies from early modern to contemporary times. Major themes include not only Islamicate legal traditions and jurisdictions, but the intersections, tensions, and synergy between Islamic law and Roman, Persianate, and European imperial legacies; fellow Abrahamic faiths and the interplay between religion and secularism; and the evolving role of international law including human rights and humanitarian law. From early schools of Islamic jurisprudence to Ottoman, Egyptian, and Iranian constitutions, and the role of lawyers and judiciaries from decolonization to the Arab Spring uprisings, our goal is to explore the depth, diversity, and transformation of legal cultures and institutions across different epochs of Middle East history.",

Tourism is a fascinating point of departure through which we can examine how histories of empire, consumerism, gender, and the environment all converge upon practices many (but certainly not all) of us take for granted. The premise of this seminar is based on two basic questions: through tourism, how do we change a place and how does that place change us? How does human mobility produce a new set of economic, social, and political relations? The answers will vary across time and space, but through engagement with scholarship and various primary sources we can come to better understand how the pleasure modern-day travelers derive from temporarily being someplace else is ultimately something deeply embedded into the structures and historical processes of the modern world itself.",

The creation of Israel in 1948 was the outcome of a bitter war with the local Arab population and the surrounding states, in the course of which most of the Palestinians were expelled or fled, facilitating the establishment of a Jewish-majority state. The seminar will discuss the fraught question of the two traumatic events of the Holocaust and the Nakba (the expulsion of 1948), and propose that we can both better understand these events, and begin the long path to reconciliation, by applying the tools of empathetic first-person history.",

This senior seminar examines environmental issues and responses under capitalism in North America and socialism in Russia and Eastern Europe. The course covers conservation and preservation; Indigenous anticolonial movements; responses to chemical and plastic pollution; anti-nuclear protest; environmental justice; climate change and anti-fossil fuel movements; and new forms of environmental organizing including the Rights of Nature movement and degrowth. Focused on the 19th and 20th centuries, the class will situate movements in ecological, political, and economic context, assess outcomes, and examine the relationships between economic form and politics. Using primary and secondary sources in a range of media, seminars will include short lectures, discussions, and student-led case studies that build toward a substantive final research project.",

For some women, state leaders, and international experts, contraception meant sexual liberation, increased autonomy, and the reduction of economic hardship. But for others, the same biomedical technologies were associated with colonial control and efforts to reduce \"undesirable\" people. How is it possible for contraception to hold such expansive and contradictory meanings? In order to assess this central question, students will engage with critical theories of gender, race, class, nationalism, and decolonization.",

This interdisciplinary course introduces students to one of the most pressing environmental justice struggles in the nation today: Cancer Alley, USA. Together, we will explore the entwined histories of slavery, settler colonialism, and racial capitalism in Louisiana and the broader Gulf South, connecting colonial history to ongoing forms of state violence. Readings draw heavily from Environmental History, Native American and Indigenous Studies (NAIS), and Black Studies to address themes of ecological devastation and embodied violence, while also highlighting practices of resistance and resurgence from historical uprisings to contemporary cultural revitalization efforts. Students will learn to critically analyze how racialized systems of power and privilege structure inequality while envisioning alternative, more just futures.",

Equally, the place of Jews in the non-Jewish world is determined not only by the attitudes of non-Jews but also by the economic, social, and political agency wielded by Jews themselves. This graduate seminar will, in a broad chronological framework, examine the complicated interplay of forces which shaped both the Jewish experience in the non-Jewish world and the non-Jewish world's treatment of its Jewish minority. Among the topics to be discussed: the places of Jews in premodern Christian and Muslim societies; Jewish early modernity; the historical trajectory of Jew-hate; changing Jewish responses to non-Jewish culture; Jewish power, powerlessness, and political development; the modern Jewish experience before, during, and after the Holocaust.",

This seminar positions violence and repair as entry-points to an ethnographic understanding of environmental harm, disturbance, and change through an interdisciplinary body of work that includes environmental history and film. The course connects recent ethnographic accounts of exposure, extraction, and pollution to critiques of violence, imperialism, and statecraft, and asks about the possibilities and limitations of repair, refusal, and survival. Reading critical theory on violence next to environmental degradation opens up space to think and learn about how colonial and state projects terra/aqua-form the environment and lifeways and calls us to think critically about environmental struggles from the perspective of resistance, repair, and non-western and non-secular responses to disaster, disruption, and change.",

We will draw on anthropology, archaeology, archival history, geography, heritage preservation, public art, and urban studies to explore colonialist tactics of spatial removal and symbolic and documentary violence aimed at erasure. Most importantly, we will look at how Indigenous people have challenged claims of their absence in urbanizing landscapes through their oral histories, writing, and material culture, and by their presence and diverse experiences in cities in the United States, Canada, Australia, and beyond.",

Building on Toni Morrison's \"Sula\" and theories from Black feminisms, queer-of-color critique, and Black ecological thought, this course views the \"bottom\" as Black queer ecological thought. We will trace how Black queer communities generate counter-knowledge, reshape racialized and sexual subjectivities, and challenge conventional environmental discourse by queering ecological analysis. Ultimately, this course examines the \"bottom\" as both a sexual position and an ecological site historically raced, and marked as disposable, dirty, abject. Readings from Morrison, Jennifer Nash, Audre Lorde, Darieck Scott, Juana Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez, Kathryn Bond Stockton, and Leo Bersani will guide our exploration of how landscapes of racial abjection and erotic desire converge, offering new critical tools for environmental humanities.",

    "description": "A critical reading of &quot;The Order of Evils: Toward an Ontology of Morals&quot; (2000), a \"poststructuralist\" moral treatise that combines phenomenological and structural analysis and is attuned to the historicity of knowledge and moral matters. The book understands evil as discrete harm, which becomes a moral matter only once it is judged as gratuitous, and an object of critique only once it is grasped in its regularity. The seminar, oriented toward revising the book, reexamines the reasoning that supports these intuitions and their implications: a transformation of moral discourse; a new ontology of \"moral things\"; the primacy of others over the self; a downgrade of \"liberty,\" \"justice,\" and \"rights\"; and a critical interest in the historical conditions of political action. Seminar participants will also read works by thinkers who inspired the project, including Kant, Marx, Heidegger, Levinas, Lyotard, and Derrida.",

    "description": "Energy shapes society, from the daily lives of local communities to patterns of global inequality. In this course, we explore the social dimensions of energy production and consumption. We start by examining fossil fuels and their wide-ranging effects on communities and the environment, then shift to the ongoing energy transitions and the social forces that help or hinder the large-scale adoption of renewables. Throughout the course, we will ask who benefits and who bears the costs of energy production and transition, and focus on understanding the equity implications of these changes and the prospects for a sustainable society. Students will develop policy analysis skills by identifying current energy challenges, assessing their social impacts, and proposing evidence-based solutions.",

Each subsequent week investigates a particular area of scholarly attention, introducing students to a handful of recent contributions. Class time will be used to provide short lectures that provide background on each issue area, as well as for broader group discussion. The course will expose students to the 'cutting edge' in international security research, and provide the analytical tools to evaluate and contribute themselves.",

This course shifts between history and the present moment to develop a layered understanding of migration and to contemplate how immigration policy has functioned in the past and may function in the future. It centers the experiences of migrants and their families as they navigate leaving home and building lives in a country simultaneously reliant on and hostile to their presence, offering insight into a complicated and shifting reality affecting millions on both sides of the border.",

Historically, one reason Americans have been thought to tolerate inequality is that we tend to believe that our society is a mobile one, where people can easily move from one social class to another. But in recent years, inequality and stagnant social mobility have been associated with increasing social and political distrust and unrest. In this junior seminar, we will examine the economic and political, and ideological factors that have contributed to this historical moment, learn about how Americans experience living in an unequal society, and consider the future of equality and social mobility in the United States. How should our society be shaped, and what are our obligations as members of that society?",

We will investigate the main drivers of great power rivalry, its manifestations across varying geographic and functional domains, as well possible methods for mitigating rivalry. While discussions will touch on middle powers and alternative great powers, the focus will be on U.S. relations with both Russia and also China. Special attention is given to the various flashpoints in these relationships, whether the on-going Ukraine War or the South China Sea and also Taiwan. Rivalry dynamics will be assessed at all the various levels of intensity, ranging from influence operations to hybrid conflicts to limited wars and even to nuclear operations. Special attention will be paid to the costs of war, as well as to ways to restrain rivalry, including dialogue, institutions, and arms control.",

Some observers argue that only market competition can enable the blossoming of human ingenuity, while others argue that state planning is essential for controlling the dangers inherent in new technologies. Rather than extol or deny the benefits that can come from technology, this course examines how governments in different historical circumstances have attempted to shape and regulate three of the most challenging risks facing advanced societies.",

In this class, we will aim to understand why we need to think about states and gender together. We will investigate this intersection by focusing on a pressing contemporary issue: reproductive rights. Throughout the course, we will think through several questions. Why do states govern reproductive decisions and what strategies do state officials use? Does state intervention in reproduction reflect assumptions about masculinity and femininity? Does state intervention exacerbate or attenuate gendered differences and inequalities? How do organized interest groups challenge or alter state policies? We will read literature from around the world, while paying special attention to the American case.",

How does it work and how has it been used throughout history to propose, support, and undermine ideas about topics as broad as nationalism, race, gender, and class? Through a focus on some of the most influential operas written in Italian, we will consider how this unique art form is both in dialogue with itself and the world around it. This course has no prerequisites and does not require prior knowledge of music nor opera.",

It combined the genres of chivalric romance, the crusading epic, and the classic heroic epic, but features ladies-errant along with knights and shrewdly satirizes hypermasculine late feudalism (the philosopher Hegel claimed it had destroyed chivalry). It helped drive Cervantes' Don Quixote mad, fueled a fierce debate in relation to Tasso's crusade epic Jerusalem Delivered, and in England influenced Sidney, Spenser, Shakespeare, Lord Byron, and Virginia Woolf (Orlando, 1928). Depending on enrollment, we will read/discuss in Italian and/or English. Readers in English will field-test a new translation by Ariosto scholar Albert Ascoli to be published by Oxford University Press.",

Beginning with a brief overview of classical and rabbinic formulations of peace as divine harmony and moral obligation, we trace how contemporary Jewish thinkers, theologians, and activists have reinterpreted peace across contexts of modernity, nationalism, and conflict. From prophetic ethics and utopian socialism to the paradoxes of Zionism and the Israeli peace camp, students engage with theological, anthropological, and political debates that reveal peace as a deeply contested but enduring ideal. Readings combine theology, political theory, ethnography, and peace studies to illuminate how Jewish traditions of dialogue, justice, and moral restraint continue to shape the pursuit of coexistence in Israel/Palestine and beyond.",

This course aims to familiarize the student with the major outlines of Israel's development, and with different narratives and interpretations of that history. The reading materials and class discussions will examine not only the Arab-Israeli conflict, but also its influence on Israeli politics, society and culture.",

Each week we shall grapple with a particular issue in translation studies in dialogue with a Korean-language text. By the end of this course students should be able to locate the tools necessary to carry out translations from Korean to English, to demonstrate an understanding of translation as a craft with its own standards, responsibilities, and complexities, and to have completed a significant translation project themselves. Learners of the Korean language who have completed Korean 600 as well as native speakers of Korean are welcome.",

At one level, understanding aspects of linguistic theory can provide insight into the internal workings of these various forms of wordplay. On another level, wordplay and puzzles often intentionally subvert the grammar and other rules of ordinary language use and therefore can provide a unique lens into typically implicit grammatical knowledge speakers possess and deploy in all domains of language.",

Broad topics include phonetics and phonology (the study of speech sounds and how they combine), morphology (the structure of words), syntax (the structure of sentences), semantics (how linguistics forms express meanings), historical linguistics (how language changes over time), and writing systems. We will also cover the history of the art of constructed languages.

Then, we will turn our attention to how individual speakers use language to construct identities, portray stances, and achieve interactional goals. Throughout the course, we will consider how ideologies about linguistic variation have been used to invalidate particular ways of speaking and disempower speakers of these varieties, and how language can reflect, reinforce, or contest social inequalities.",

Although many linguistic models assume a monolingual speaker, most of the world's population is bi- or multilingual. What does it mean to be bilingual rather than monolingual? How does knowing two languages shape linguistic behavior? What are the consequences of bilingualism for both language use and broader cognitive abilities? How do these realities align\u2014or clash\u2014with social attitudes and public policy? Drawing on data from a wide range of bilingual communities, students will engage with research from psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics to begin addressing these questions. Topics include language comprehension and production, acquisition, the mental representation of dual language knowledge, and the cognitive effects of bilingualism. We will also examine the social context of bilingualism, the advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism, and their implications for linguistic theory.",

In other words, when we rely on only a reader's perspective to guide us as artists, it provides little to no sense of artistic path. This workshop is for writers of all levels to explore several works-in-progress in more depth. The result will be an enhanced relationship to the works (and to process) and to a lifelong and sustainable creativity. Becoming a more curious and helpful reader of others is another tangible and valuable outcome. Open to all.",

    "description": "How does one speak the unspeakable? What rhetorical and rhythmical strategies can the poet use to write the ineffable? How can the practice of writing be used not only to document mystical experience, but to cultivate ceremonial attentiveness? This poetry workshop/seminar explores the intersection of mysticism and poetry. We will investigate how writers across traditions (Islamic mysticism, Christian mysticism, Neoplatonism, pantheism, atheistic mysticism) and eras use language to approach the divine. Through a combination of close reading, seminar-style discussion, and creative workshop, students will engage with core mystical concepts (apophasis, union, ecstasy, divine madness, love, the body, suffering, horror) and draw on these themes and strategies for inspiration into their own creative work.",

Short shorts, paradoxically, are heavily theme-based and thus tend to cover eternity. In this course, we will discuss the thematic underpinnings of micro fiction, and we will visit with the ways in which short shorts are structured differently from longer stories. We will examine the idea of pacing, as it is rendered in micro fiction, so that we might learn how to use such economy of words in our own micro fiction or traditional-length fiction. Each student will turn in at least three pieces of micro fiction or magical realism, and as final projects, you will revise two of these.",

As the notion of nation-state has increasingly been problematized, the concept of \"national cinema,\" which frames cinematic works according to their countries of origin, has come into question. This course revisits this theoretical debate by exploring the transnational connections among different film cultures in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea. The course will emphasize as much the local diversities and specificities as the stylistic, generic, thematic, and industrial conjunctions across national/cultural boundaries. While surveying major genres and auteurs in East Asian cinemas, such as Wong Kar-Wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Ozu, Kurosawa, Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho, through the theoretical frameworks of nationalism, transnationalism, post-colonialism, and globalism, the course will particularly focus on the shifting representation of identities of gender,",

It is also meant to give you a different way to think about the basic concepts in film history and theory, moving away from the assumption of an essentially photographic medium to consider different ways in which moving images are produced, received, and appreciated.",

    "description": "This film and media production course explores historical and contemporary archives as sites of both artistic and critical intervention. Engaging with questions of inscription, memory, erasure, and historical re-imagination, students will examine how artists and filmmakers repurpose archival materials to craft counter-histories and speculative narratives. Through workshops in video and image-making, screenings, discussions, and guest lectures by invited artists and filmmakers, students will engage with archives as spaces for critical inquiry and poetic retrieval. Each student will select one or more archives to develop a major project that reinterprets, recontextualizes, or reimagines the retrieved material. The course will culminate in a final group exhibition and screening at the MCM Carriage House.",

    "description": "Our course will examine the conceptual pair or binary opposition: \"theory and practice\" (\"practice and t bheory\"). Ubiquitous across the disciplines, arts, and sciences, in civic discourse and popular imaginaries, this couple is articulated as a pernicious hierarchy, fundamental critical insight, and stubbornly persistent ideology. Its theorists (also its practitioners) have elaborated its constitutive force, exposed its reifications, exploited its powers, and demystified its ideologies. Refigured and displaced, refused but persistently at work, the terms of this distinction have been aligned with myriad potent critical concepts: the abstract, intelligible, ideal, and subject ranged against the concrete, sensible, material, and object; mind versus body, thought versus experience. We'll query these accounts in readings ranging from Marx, Moten, and Spivak to Wilson, Althusser, Kornbluh, and de Kretser, emphasizing literary theoretical instantiations of the problem of a genuinely theoretical practice.",

Indeed, Freud never stopped thinking of himself as a scientist who wished, as he put it, to \"leave his psychoanalytic calling card\" with the biologists. What does this mean? What happens to biology when it is retrofitted with an unconscious? We will examine various texts of Freud, Lacan, Canguilhem, Bergson, and Deleuze, among others and sort out their intricacies by reading them in relation to the paintings of Francis Bacon, films as The Cow (Merjui, 1969, the works of the bizarre architect, Patrick Geddes.",

Since punk's arrival in the US and the UK in the 1970s, its subcultures and cultural productions have been associated with practices of dissent and refusal in the face of authoritarian political and cultural forces. Over the course of the semester, we attend to the unruly sounds, textures and manifestos of punk, with a particular emphasis on Black and Brown punk provocateurs, race, class and gender relations, collaboration, DIY practices, and creativity \"underground.\"",

Drawing on Persian poetry, Sufism, and Islamic philosophy \u2013 while also influenced by modern movements like Italian neorealism and the French New Wave \u2013 Iranian cinema stands out for its sophistication and artistic originality. This course surveys its evolution from the 1960s to today, examining how major cultural and political events, from the 1979 Revolution to the Woman, Life, Freedom uprisings (2022\u20132023), have shaped cinematic expression. Students will explore themes of censorship, gender relations, sexualities, intimacy, love, and friendship, analyzing how filmmakers navigate moral and political constraints to create profound works of art.

What is the relationship between our ways of thinking and the energy regimes that have prevailed at different points in history? This course reframes the Middle East in modern global history (1750\u2013present) from the perspective of different energy sources: water, wood, coal, oil, gas, wind, and sun. It highlights the production, circulation, and consumption of energy in processes of capitalist development; state construction (and destruction); imperialism, mass politics, and cultural difference; formation and maintenance of citizenship and migration regimes; and authoritarian rule. If global heating will render much of the Middle East uninhabitable by the end of the century, how did we get here and what does the future hold?",

Taking these observations seriously and critically, this seminar asks what this international order was \u2013 or was imagined to be \u2013 and why the war in Gaza is seen to epitomize this order's dismantling. While making Gaza the perspective from which this international order, and its image, will be studied, the seminar will focus on three key concepts: Holocaust, Genocide, and Settler Colonialism. We will examine how each concept is used to make sense of the violence in Gaza, to conceive the international order whose end Gaza marks, and to recognize the dismantling of this order, or its image.",

It examines eight intertwined issue areas that any effort to reduce inequality must confront: 1) job quality and \"bad jobs\"; 2.) place winners and place losers; 3.) work, family, and policy; 4.) the supply of affordable housing and housing insecurity; 5.) climate threats and inequality 6). criminal justice: the school to prison pipeline; 7) the digital divide, algorithms, and inequality; 8) immigration. In each, we pay special attention to how racial and ethnic, and gender inequalities interact with these policy domains to reinforce inequality. The focus of the class is on the United States but in each of these domains we will draw comparisons from different parts of the world to understand how the United States is similar or different.",

After reviewing the fundamentals of state policymaking, we will focus on four substantive areas: environmental justice; housing policy; constitutional and civil rights; and health care. We will find throughout the course that these substantive areas overlap in complex ways at the individual and societal level. During the semester you will engage in group discussions, debate and roleplaying exercises, complete two written assignments, and prepare a final \"State Law, Policy and Advocacy Project\" on a subject of your choosing. Readings will include: a policy textbook, Deborah Stone's Policy Paradox; an ethnography, Desmond's",

Through research and improvisational practice, we will explore these questions: What can I \"hear\" in the beat, in the room, in the present cypher that I can converse with / build upon? How can I use imperfection to my advantage? Classes will focus on deep listening analysis of music and videos, discussion of readings, freestyle exercises, and rap cypher workshops.

The musical work always in focus, it traces his development from a young piano virtuoso writing for his own performances to the creator of late, highly abstract spiritual works that completely leave the realm of &quot;performance music&quot;. Alongside a study of his highly dramatic life and spheres of influence, we will examine his early works and trace the development of his musical language within the different Genres.",

As an instrument which emerges directly from the body, and conveying extra-musical meaning via text, the voice is unique in its ability to create drama, engender narrative, and address corporeality in sound. In this course, students will engage with the many modes in which the voice has been utilized in western classical music, from canonical forms such as opera, lieder/chansons, choral writing and narration to ancient forms such as chant and organum, as well as more recent innovations including extended techniques, electronic augmentation, and AI vocal models, all while exploring their own compositional technique for the instrument. This course will start as a seminar consisting of group analyses of vocal music, before shifting to a studio environment engaging in the critique of original work by students.",

Using Paul Gilroy's framework of \"the Black Atlantic\" (and at times critiquing it), this seminar-style class will delve into various Rhode Island-based, local manifestations of Afro-Black music-making \u2013 from the Nuyorican hip-hop technology nexus to the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira to the melancholic Cabo Verdean morna \u2013 as a lens through which to study global processes of sonic racialization, colonial/imperial musical assemblage, and trans-diasporic creativity. In this course, we will open ourselves to aesthetic and intellectual encounter with the sonic traditions of local Black diaspora communities -- and their practitioners.",

This seminar is not intended to develop a monolithic understanding of the field, but to explore the range of problems, methodologies, trajectories of inquiry and political aims across different kinds of NAIS scholarship. To gain a specific sense of these various approaches, we focus on scholarship-in-progress, building the syllabus based on areas of interest and expertise, finalized in a capstone project, practicum, internship or thesis. As the culmination of the concentration, the capstone may take the form of a research paper, project, and/or engaged experience or internship accompanied by a write up (thesis, report, digital product)",

In doing so, they often draw tools from philosophical value theory: applying ideas about justice, the common good, ethics, and welfare in their efforts to reform or improve social institutions (e.g. an economy that maximizes utility, a constitution that enshrines rights). In order to do this work, scholars and practitioners of PPE need to develop familiarity with key concepts and distinctions from value theory. This course will familiarize participants with these tools and train them in their application. It will show how value theory can better equip us to respond in a reasoned and defensible way to hotly disputed questions of public policy in areas such as water rights allocation, migration, climate governance, and antitrust law.",

Many of our beliefs are formed on the basis of testimony\u2014by reading or hearing about facts that we have not directly observed. One of the central questions of social epistemology is how we ought to treat testimonial evidence. Should we accept testimony at face value, or should we require further evidence that the testimony comes from a trustworthy source? How can we determine that a source is trustworthy? Questions about testimony naturally lead to questions about epistemic injustice. Do we unfairly inflate or discount the testimony of an individual based on their gender, race, or class? Do current epistemic practices and institutions unfairly advantage or disadvantage particular bodies of knowledge? How can we ameliorate these injustices?",

Lucretius describes at length the \"ills\" that are \"experienced in love that is steadfast and supremely successful\"\u2014and adds that \"when love is frustrated and unrequited, the miseries you can spot with your eyes shut are countless\" (On the Nature of Things 4, trans.

It begins with the origins of modern deep learning in early neural network models and the connectionist approach, considering its premises, promises, and limitations. Explanations for the Deep Learning Revolution will then be considered. Subsequent topics include how to understand AI models as models of cognition, the interpretability of neural network models, whether language models have genuine mental states, and how to evaluate claims about alignment, agency, and consciousness. Students will engage with both technical and philosophical texts while developing their own analyses. No prerequisites, though some background in philosophy, computer science, or cognitive science is recommended.",

We'll discuss the three main proposals, that knowledge is perception, true judgment, and true judgment with an account. We'll also discuss a fourth possibility introduced at the outset, that knowledge is expertise (techn\u0113). Of all Plato's works, the Theaetetus is the most appealing from a contemporary philosophical perspective, because its final section has been taken to propose a popular 20th century view of knowledge\u2014as justified true belief\u2014and to state difficulties with that proposal. Much else in the dialogue will be discussed: e.g., Socrates' midwifery, Protagorean relativism, the famous Digression interrupting the critique of relativism; parts and wholes; and the notion of logos (account). Readings will be in English.",

We will discuss controversies about shame, such as: Is shame an essentially social emotion? Is shame essentially heteronomous? Is shame essentially an emotion of self-assessment? Can shame be an appropriate moral emotion? And we will compare and contrast shame from affective states closely associated with it, such as guilt and self-regarding regret, or feeling self-conscious and feeling embarrassed.",

While this course will introduce a spectrum of community-engaged research approaches, we will focus primarily on the community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. We will begin with an introduction to community-engaged research's concepts and principles and a brief history on the theories that shaped CBPR, including how power/privilege influence the way each individual approaches research. We will then move through case studies of CBPR projects and how specific methods can be applied within CBPR. We will end with examples on how CBPR can be used to help shape health policy and advocacy. Students will engage in interactive learning through facilitated discussions, case studies, and reflective activities, will learn real-life applications of CBPR from invited guest speakers and work in groups to complete a community-engaged project.",

Students will examine U.S. and global harm reduction policies and programs, service models, emerging technologies, and the contributions of the harm reduction workforce. Weekly spotlights address communities disproportionately affected by drug-related harms, including people of color, gender-diverse individuals, and people experiencing housing instability. Through case studies, guest speakers, and community-based learning, students will develop an evidence-informed, community-driven harm reduction intervention tailored to a specific population and setting.",

Key course topics include the role of surveillance in public health; the development of case definitions and the collection of data; the assessment of common accuracy limitations in surveillance or secondary data; approaches for cleaning complex data; descriptive statistics generation; sampling and stratification methods; program and policy evaluation; and effective communication in public health practice.

    "description": "Museums are spaces of collection and representation. They are also keepers of knowledge. Museum collections and knowledge are constructed through distinctive power relations. There are of course different kinds of museums but the ethnographic museum has been one center piece of colonial collections. This course will examine how the collections of many museums were established. After this historical collection working through an genealogical method the course will then pay attention to the contemporary debates and practices of various attempts to decolonize various museums. In this regard we will pay attention to four museums: the Tropen Museum in Amsterdam; the British museum, Boston Museum of Fine Arts and to the National Art Gallery of South Africa.",

Topics to be covered include some topics in linear optics (Fourier optics, coherence) and lasers (fundamentals of laser operation, gain and gain saturation, resonators, transient laser phenomena). We will then discuss light-matter interactions in the nonlinear regime, relying on a classical or semi-classical treatment. Topics will include frequency conversion via mixing or parametric processes, and degenerate third-order self-induced effects. Time permitting, we will discuss some of the most recent breakthroughs in optically-driven nonlinear processes such as the generation of attosecond pulses (physics Nobel Prize 2023).",

We will then discuss light-matter interactions in the nonlinear regime, relying on a classical or semi-classical treatment. Topics will include frequency conversion via mixing or parametric processes, and degenerate third-order self-induced effects. Time permitting, we will discuss some of the most recent breakthroughs in optically driven nonlinear processes such as the generation of attosecond pulses (physics Nobel Prize 2023).",

Through readings, films, and creative activities, students will examine how women artists transform personal experience into collective expression and how art becomes a space for rewriting the past and imagining new futures.

It explores how Portugal's national myth of a country open to diversity, shaped by its colonial past, obscures issues of racism and migration. The course traces how migration policies have evolved in a postcolonial context, analyzes media's role in perpetuating stereotypes, and investigates the rise of far-right anti-immigration mobilization. It also highlights immigrant resistance to these changes. Using Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy, the course encourages collaborative learning and participatory practices, fostering dialogue and decolonizing methodologies in migration studies. Students will engage actively in discussions, readings, and reflections, contributing to an exchange of ideas among students, faculty, and guest lecturers.

This seminar is premised on three ideas \u2013 that to understand Taiwan, one must go beyond the geopolitical, and instead delve deeply into Taiwan's multi-century political evolution; that doing so will offer insights into some of the most significant macro-political phenomena in human history (e.g., settler colonialism, imperialism, authoritarianism, democratization, etc.); and, that doing so will also offer greater understanding of, and a wider range of potential solutions for, contemporary geopolitical concerns. Topics include Taiwan under Dutch rule, Taiwan as part of the Qing Empire, Taiwan's socio-political evolution under Japanese colonial rule, the building of the KMT state on Taiwan, authoritarianism and the \"White Terror,\" Taiwan's democratization, and post-democratization identity formation.",

Finally, both state-based and criminal actors and institutions influence the level of violence in society. Each of these three influences, and is influenced by, the others.

To understand these outcomes, the course draws on theories of policymaking, public administration, public law, and institutionalism as frameworks of analysis. Substantive topics include the US welfare state, legislative politics, federalism, the influence of racial politics in policymaking, policy feedback, the consequences of partisan polarization for governance, and government as a problem-solving institution.",

The second half of the course deals with the plumbing, which is how politics influences money in the real world. This includes issues of financial governance, financial sanctions, inflation and the offshore financial system. Although finance is now more prominent in IPE research it remains at the frontier of research topics in mainstream IPE. As such, it is an excellent area to conduct research since it remains, to steal a line from one of the field's pioneers, Susan Strange, an 'open range' of inquiry.",

More than other intellectual traditions, black political thought has been centrally concerned with racism and inequality, but also black refusal and black life. We will pay special attention to the distinctive concepts and modes of theorizing developed by black thinkers, particularly how they conceive the relationship between race, class, gender, sexuality, etc. Rather than providing an overview of black political thought in all times and places, the course will focus on close readings of a few key thinkers.",

We explore the set of tools that is conventionally considered to comprise qualitative methods, including case studies, small-N comparisons, process tracing, sequential analysis, interviews and participant observation. Starting from the premise that each research method has its strengths and weaknesses, we also consider how qualitative methods can be combined productively with other methods of inquiry, including \"large-N\" quantitative analysis, experiments, spatial/geographic analysis, and multilevel analysis spanning different scales.",

And while this approach has enabled scholars to neatly prescribe what counts as religious, it's also caused them to ignore the ways people's daily faith practices make a mess of this work. Drawing on sub-fields in religious studies, anthropology, and sociology, this course explores how formal ideas of religion expand when confronted with the normality of everyday life. From cooking and talking to prayer and devotion, the \"religious\" and \"non-religious\" things people do tell us a lot about how religion animates and is animated by lived experience, and how porous the boundary is between the \"sacred\" and \"profane\".",

These traditions offer diverse narratives, discourses, and prescriptions, which shaped and informed women's religious lives. In some cases, female practitioners are treated positively, while in others, we find more disparaging depictions. As we examine the treatment of female practitioners within these traditions, we will also observe how specific historical women navigated gender expectations, created their own spaces of practice, and offered their own interpretations. The geographical breadth of the course, which includes China, Japan, and Korea, will allow us to consider historical continuities and departures between these different regions. Finally, we will also deliberate on the ways these traditions can confront and address modern issues related to women and gender.",

    "description": "What does it mean to receive a message from a god? How have ordinary people in Chinese history used writing not just to record the divine\u2014but to produce it? This seminar explores spirit writing (fuji \u6276\u4e69), a ritual practice of communicating with gods, ghosts, and immortals through writing, and the broader world of Chinese popular religion from which it emerged. Through case studies of mountain cults, female immortals, child mediums, and moral texts, we will examine how people across Chinese history sought divine insight, legitimacy, and healing. Readings include miracle tales, ritual manuals, and planchette transcripts, alongside scholarship from anthropology, history, and religious studies. Students will gain new perspectives on the creative, contested, and often gendered process of engaging with the spirit world.",

This course explores India's vibrant cinematic landscape in the 21st century, from Bollywood blockbusters to boundary-pushing independent films, that grapple with love, desire, gender, caste, religion, corruption, and activism. We'll ask how filmmakers turn the camera into an instrument of social critique and emotional transformation. How do sound, color, and image shape awareness, empathy, and revolt? Through close viewing, discussion, and creative analysis, students will engage the politics and poetics of India's visual storytelling in a time of rapid globalization and cultural flux. Tracing cinema's evolution from postcolonial roots to its digital, transnational reach today, the course invites you to see how contemporary films both mirror and challenge the realities of modern India\u2014and how they ask audiences everywhere to feel, question, and reimagine the world anew.",

Though used for millennia in indigenous ceremonies and religious rites, it is only in the last century that they have played a role in Western science, medicine, and culture. Literally \"manifesting the soul,\" psychedelics have been both stigmatized and hyped, remaining illegal or controversial in many contemporary contexts even as they are marketed as the \"next big thing\" in mental health care. This course compares and contrasts the cultural and ontological contexts for psychedelic use from indigenous and religious ceremonies to contemporary scientific clinical trials and neuroscience. Along the way, pressing questions within the psychedelic field will be investigated from an interdisciplinary lens and with an appreciation for history and context.",

It takes up these questions in relation to historical and contemporary archives, and it prioritizes feminist, critical race, and queer analysis. Readings and course themes press boundaries of how we might think about religion and reveal new directions for an analysis and critique of capitalism. We will ask questions like the following: How can we trace the growth of the idea that participation in global free markets can facilitate relations of justice? What moral frameworks and theories of human life underwrite the vision of capital markets as a theater for political-ethical action? Under what circumstances can capitalist philosophies and practices be understood in terms of religion?",

From the early Middle Ages onward people asked, what kind of all-powerful God holds humans accountable for things out of their power to control? If people are in fact in control of their own actions, what would that say about the nature and power of God? Does evil come from people or God, and if the latter, what does that say about the nature of Divinity?

Drawing on a variety of sources, including novels, biographies, film, media reports, and contemporary scholarly research, the course explores the concepts of race, belonging, otherness, and duality as they evolved in Russia's varying historical contexts. Particular attention is paid to comparisons of racialization and racial injustice in America and in Russia. From classic Russian literature, to Soviet propaganda, to contemporary geopolitics, the course asks: How has \"blackness\" been historically understood and/or used by Russians, and what cultural and political legacies has that left in Russia's post- imperial and post-Soviet space?",

We will examine theories, characteristics, and trends of socioeconomic inequality in the U.S., focusing on how this inequality shapes children's life chances. In the process, this course will help us think about what an ideal level of equality of opportunity might look like and social changes that could help us achieve it.",

From anatomical theaters to observatories, natural history museums, labs, and rainforests, people have struggled with the politics and poetics of visualizing and communicating \"invisible\" objects \u2013 things that were too far away, too small, too ephemeral, too dead, or otherwise hidden from human sight. Asking how scientists and artists were trained to see, we will study the history of observation from the early modern period to the present. This class will include workshops at the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, the Nature Lab, and RISD's glass studios. Students need not have any hands-on experience in the arts or sciences, but we will practice both in class.",

    "description": "This course explores contemporary performances and visual art by queer and trans artists that center the body as a prism for identity-formation, affect, and objecthood. These artists activate their bodies to push back against prevailing cis and heteronormative aesthetic and cultural norms through frameworks and practices, like masochism, beauty, abjection, and eroticism. Drawing from Queer and Trans Studies, we perform formal analysis of their texts, contextualizing them within various institutions and structures of power. We will reflect on the experience of our own encounter with their works. This course surveys the works of contemporary Hemispheric trans and queer artists of color to ultimately ask: what connective threads (if any) can we identify in the work of these artists? What can their work tell us about trans and queer experiences of settler colonialism, diaspora, and racialization?",

Students will build visual, technical, and critical thinking skills through an exploration of materials in space, with particular interest to the relationship between objects, environments, and people. The course begins with a studio-based inquiry into constructing objects through traditional and non-traditional additive, subtractive, and transformative methods. The inquiry will continue beyond studio production and into alternative and public spaces, with an introduction to installation art, social practice, performance art, and dematerialized practices. The focus of the course is on interdisciplinary experimentation of complex ideas through problem solving, laying the groundwork for advanced courses in the arts.",

This course will focus on the genre of performance art which lies between most other art disciplines and includes raw feelings (not acted emotions), political views and above all else, the embodiment of physical actions as art.",

    "description": "Other Lives of Time takes a decidedly poetic approach to moving image and cinema. Part studio, screening, discussion and critique, we will watch, discuss and dissect works by artists and filmmakers from across the globe that use personal form and distinct techniques to communicate idiosyncratically. Readings will explore contemporary notions of time and cinema while screenings prioritize nonfiction and fiction works that have mainstream audience potential. Assignments will expand student's filmic language as they work over the semester toward the completion of a short film that employs a singular structure.",
